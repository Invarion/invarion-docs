This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Prerequisites

Local machine should have the following tools installed:

1. [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) or higher
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
1. [Git tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
1. IDE (preferably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Installation

``` bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

``` bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having
to restart the server.

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
