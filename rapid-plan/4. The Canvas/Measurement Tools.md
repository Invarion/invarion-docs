# Measurement Tools

The measurement tools will enable you to quickly measure distances, angles and areas on your plan. Measurements are precise, zoom-independent and can be saved as marker objects.

Click on to the measurement tools button to bring up the toolbar - there are 6 different measurement tools to work with as well as appropriate measurement units to apply.

Each measurement tool just requires a click and then another click at desired point/s to find the measurement between different points.
