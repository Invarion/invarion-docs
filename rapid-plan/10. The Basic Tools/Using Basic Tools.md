# Using these Basic Tools

The technique for drawing with these tools varies from object to object. Many of the objects such as Rectangles, Ellipses, and Rounded Rectangles are simple two-control point structures. Polylines, Polygons, Splines, Arcs, and Beziers can have as many points as you like. Irrespective, the process is simple.

## To Draw any Line or Shape

- Select the tool from the corresponding tab in the Tools Palette.
- Click to place the first control point.
- Continue clicking until the necessary number of points are placed and the object is complete.
- Right click to stop drawing.
- Right click again to drop the tool.
