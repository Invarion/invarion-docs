# Adding/Deleting a Control Point

You can add a control point to an object, for example if you want to add a curve to a train track, by selecting the object, right clicking and selecting **Insert Control Point**.

**Note:** This option will only appear for objects that can utilize extra control points.

Similarly, you can remove control points by selecting the object, right clicking and selecting **Remove Control Point**.
