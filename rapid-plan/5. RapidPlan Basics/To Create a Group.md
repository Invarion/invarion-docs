- **Ungroup** - ungroups the grouped objects

    **Note**: The individual bounding boxes and move handles are replaced by just one for the entire group.

2.Using your mouse or keyboard:

- Select the objects you want to group together (by pressing **SHIFT** and selecting each desired object individually or by dragging your mouse encompassing all of the desired objects).
- Right click and select **Group objects** from context menu
- Or hold **CTRL + G**.
