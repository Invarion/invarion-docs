To view these additional mapping providers, go to the  **Base map**  section of the Properties palette. Select the  **Provider**  dropdown menu. Click  **More providers...**. In the dialogue box (displayed in Figure 14.3), check the providers you want to use. These will then become visible in the dropdown menu.

**Please note**: Access to content from NearMap and Metromap (both available to users in USA, Australia and New Zealand) requires a paid subscription to those services.
