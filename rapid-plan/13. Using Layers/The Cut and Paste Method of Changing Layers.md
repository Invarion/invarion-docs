# The Cut/Paste Method of Changing Layers

This method of shifting between layers is to simply cut or copy the desired objects from one layer and paste them to another. This option is best if you want to duplicate items from one layer to the next.

**To cut/copy and paste items to a new layer:**

 1.Select the object(s) you wish to move.
 2.Cut or copy your selection:

- To move, use **Edit** > **Cut** from the main menu (or press **CTRL + X**)
- To copy, use **Edit** > **Copy** from the main menu (or press **CTRL + C**)
 3.Move to the desired layer that you wish to paste the objects using the Layer Selector box.
 4.Paste your objects:

- If you don't care where they are pasted on the page, either press **CTRL + V** or select **Edit** > **Paste** from the main menu.
