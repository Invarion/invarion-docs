# Creating a Multi Message Sign

When this tool is selected, a **Multi Message Sign Wizard** box will appear where you make all the necessary adjustments to the message board you will be utilizing in your plan. You will have many different signs to choose from and select up to four signs for the message board. You can filter signs by state's library (**QLD**, **SA**, **VIC**, **WA**) and you can have your own **Custom Signs**.
