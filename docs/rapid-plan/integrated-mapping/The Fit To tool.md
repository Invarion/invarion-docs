# The 'Fit To' tool

The Fit Objects (or Fit To) tool is the fastest way to align an imported image or object with background mapping or another imported object.

To use it:

- Place the object you plan to overlay to the side of the mapping area or object that you wish to place it on top of.
Right click the object > Transform > Fit To.
-A small dialog box will appear in the top-left corner of the Canvas area with a slider to alter the opacity of the live preview image that will appear.
- Draw a line between 2 points on the object between 2 recognisable points.
- Now draw a line between the same two points on the background mapping, being careful to match with the first line.
- If you would like to undo a point, right click and try again.
- Once both lines have been drawn and the images are aligned, click Enter to finish.

When drawing the second line an opaque preview of the overlay will appear, to help you confirm that the images are aligned accurately. The opacity of this preview can be changed using the dialog box in the top-left.
