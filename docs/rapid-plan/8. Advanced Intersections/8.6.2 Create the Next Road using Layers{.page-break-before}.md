4. Now stay on the **Bridge** layer and draw a 2-lane road that runs north south between the extended roads drawn in step 2.
5. Add two roads, convert them to single lanes and add 1 control point half way along each of the new side roads as shown.

6. Using the two control points on the side roads, shape them both down until they meet neatly with the side entrances to the east-west road. We have left a gap in the top one so that you can see how we have done it.
