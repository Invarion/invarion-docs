## Sign stands


All sign devices can display an adjustable stand icon to specify their exact position and orientation.

When a sign is selected, a Sign stand icon will display to the left of the sign, which functions as a control point for adding new stands linked to that sign. While the sign is selected, left-click and drag the stand icon to the desired position and release to drop in place.  To adjust the orientation of the sign stand, simply left-click and move the red control point extending off the front to the desired orientation.

To move the sign stand again, just select the stand then left click the blue control point and drag to the new position.
