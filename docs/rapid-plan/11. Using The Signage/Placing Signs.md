# Placing Signs

Placing signs is simple. Once your sign is placed you can move, resize and rotate it.

**To place a sign:**

 - Select the desired sign from the **Sign Palette** by clicking on it.
 - Float the sign out onto the canvas with the mouse. (You don't have to hold the mouse button
while you drag your sign.)
 - If you want to rotate your sign 90 degrees; use **CTRL + R**.
 - Click to drop the sign on the canvas.
