## Using signs

Because RapidPlan contains all the tools necessary to create your own signs, we need to devote an entire section of the user manual to this topic. Therefore, the signage section of the user guide is broken into two halves. This Chapter deals with using the signs in RapidPlan (placing/rotating/resizing/etc.). The next Chapter is for advanced users, and covers the creation, modification and saving of signs.
