Clicking on Sign In will direct the user to a browser window to enter the username and password provided by Invarion. Once the credentials have been entered and the details are accepted, you will be prompted to close the browser window and return to the Launcher.

**If you have forgotten your password**, simply click the 'Forgot your password' link under the login area, you will then be sent to another browser window with steps on resetting your password.

Once the user has logged into the Launcher client, the applications assigned to that user will display. Clicking 'Open' will launch that specific application.

If an update is required, the Launcher will automatically download and apply this prior to launching the application.

To manually check for any updates, simply click the refresh icon in the top left of the Launcher window.
