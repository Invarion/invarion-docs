#  Properties of the Road Tool

Of all the tools in RapidPlan, the Road has by far the most power and flexibility. Accordingly, there are a great many settings you can alter to set your road up as you require. You can change:

 - Road color, geometry and auto merge
 - Lane number, width, color and lane markings
 - Left side/right side edge line, shoulder and sidewalk widths and colors
 - Distance markers
 - Legend and manifest preferences

All of the above settings are accessed through the road properties screen. You can access the properties screen by double clicking on the road you need to change from the Quick Edit mode or from the Properties palette.
