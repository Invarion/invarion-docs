# Working Offline or via Proxy

**Single-machine RapidPlan license holders** will be able to access RapidPlan without an Internet connection for up to 14 days at a time. This 14 day period resets every time the Invarion Launcher is accessed while the computer is connected to the internet.

**Multi-machine RapidPlan license holders** will require internet access when the license is in use.

For users who have limited internet connectivity at their workstation, a proxy mode is available. This setup requires a networked server with internet access. Please contact Invarion for more information on utilizing this feature.
