# Downloading RapidPlan - The Invarion Launcher

**Please note:**

- Admin access is not required for this install. We highly recommend installing on individual user profiles.
- The Invarion Launcher will install Microsoft's Visual C++ runtime onto your machine. This is required to operate Google Maps.
- Please contact our [Support team](https://invarion.com/au/support/) if an .msi install is required or if you have difficulty with installation.
- If RapidPlan is required on a Mac computer, please see [this page](/rapid-plan/faqs/can-i-run-rapidplan-on-a-mac.md) for information.

## Accessing RapidPlan with the Invarion Launcher

Now that the Invarion Launcher is installed, if it's the first time a user is logging in, you will be presented with the below instructions when you open the Invarion Launcher.

Clicking on Sign In will direct the user to a browser window to enter the username and password that has been created (for more details on managing users, please visit our *Account Management* section).
Once the credentials have been entered and the details are accepted, you will be prompted to close the browser window and return to the Launcher.

**If you have forgotten your password**, simply click the 'Forgot your password' link under the login area, you will then be sent to another browser window with steps on resetting your password.

Once the user has logged into the Launcher client, the applications assigned to that user will display. Clicking 'Open' will launch that specific application.

If an update is required, or installation for your first use of RapidPlan, the Launcher will automatically download and apply this prior to launching the application.

To manually check for any updates, simply click the refresh icon in the top left of the Launcher window.

This will detail the current RapidPlan version you are using, as well as any signage add-ons that have been assigned to your RapidPlan license.

## Other Invarion Launcher controls
