# Changing the user of a license

Licenses can be reassigned to new users, or in the case of multi-machine licenses additional users can be added to the list of assigned users. This task can be completed by any user in the account with administrative permissions - for details on how they can do so please visit our *Account Managment* section.

If a single-machine license has been transferred to a new user after a prior one has used the RapidPlan license, this will incur a *transfer delay*.

## Transferring a License

Based on the current License Agreement in place of ***"One license per user, per machine"***, a single-machine RapidPlan license can only be activated on a single user profile on a particular computer. Activation on another machine or on another profile on the same PC requires an additional RapidPlan license or a multi-machine license (for details on multi-machine licenses please contact our [sales team](https://invarion.com/au/contact/)).

If a second activation of a single-machine license occurs, a 12 hour transfer delay will be experienced on the new profile/computer that is attempting access of the license - and the original profile/computer will lose access.

The transfer delay will begin when the **'Transfer'** button is clicked next to the RapidPlan license in the Invarion Launcher. Once the 12 hours has passed the license will then be coupled to that profile/computer, and will be ready to use.
