# Transferring License

Based on the current License Agreement in place of ***"One license per user, per machine"***, a RapidPlan account can only be activated on a single user profile on a particular computer. Activation on another machine or on another profile on the same PC requires another RapidPlan license, otherwise, subsequent activation of the same license will render the program automatically deactivated on the original user account profile.
