## The Scroll Bars

Using the scroll bars like virtually all desktop publishing programs (and virtually all other Windows applications) RapidPlan has a set of scrollbars along the edge of the canvas allowing you to move up, down and across the canvas. This will be the primary way that you will move around in RapidPlan.
