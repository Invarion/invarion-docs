## Creating print frames

Print frames can be defined either for individual print regions or for the whole plan (in which case the same frame will be used for all print regions). To create a plan frame, use the toolbar button. To create a print region frame, double click on the region's print frame icon. A popup dialog appears, confirming that you're about to create a new print frame. Once a print frame is created the corresponding icon changes color and can be used to open the frame editor view.

The print frame editor view presents a preview of the printout page with TCP contents scaled to fit inside the page (page size, orientation, margins and the content scaling mode are based on the current print options). You can now start drawing frame objects on top of this page preview and they'll be positioned exactly the same way when you actually print or export the plan. The frame editor mode allows using all kinds of objects and editing them like on a regular plan layer.

Once you're done editing the frame, you click one of the red X icons or press the **Escape** key to go back to close the frame editor view. Anytime you need to edit the frame again, use the plan toolbar or print region frame icon. Alternatively, right-click on the print region icon and select **Edit print frame**.
