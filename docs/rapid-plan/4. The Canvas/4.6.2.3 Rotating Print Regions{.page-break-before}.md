## Rotating Print Regions

Print regions placed on the canvas area can also be rotated. This is useful when planning works on a long and windy road, where each page might need a slightly different bearing

To rotate a print region, click on the printer icon in the bottom left of the print region, then use the rotation handles on each corner of the print region to rotate to any angle.

When the print region is selected, you can also adjust the exact degree of the bearing in the Properties palette under the ''Region'' subheading.
