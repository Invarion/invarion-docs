## The Canvas-Shift Technique 

There is another way to move around the canvas which can be very helpful, especially when you are zoomed a long way in. Holding down the **SPACE BAR**, then dragging on the canvas with the mouse will cause the canvas to move and follow the mouse. It is an extremely efficient way of moving around, because your mouse need not leave the canvas to action the scroll bars.
