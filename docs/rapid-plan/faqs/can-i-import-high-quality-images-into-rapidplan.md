# Can I import high quality images into RapidPlan?

Formats like JPG, PNG are what’s called raster images, or bitmaps, which means they’re fixed sets of pixels. It’s not possible to scale them without losing quality. To see quality improve, set the option in **Tools->Preferences->Application->Image Options->Exported image resolution** to produce images up to 8 times larger than the normal size. With this option set, the plan will be enlarged and then exported to an image, making the image larger and more suitable for printing.

**Note:** RapidPlan is based on vector graphics (not raster), so it can scale its objects with no loss in quality. However, RapidPlan is not able to scale imported images without loss in quality (like background aerial photos). Because of this, if you are planning to export back to an image, it is best to begin by using only high-resolution images.
