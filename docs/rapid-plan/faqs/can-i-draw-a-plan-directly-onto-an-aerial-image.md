# Can I draw a plan directly onto an aerial image?

Yes. RapidPlan can display a dynamic basemap preview on the plan drawing canvas. You can then download aerial tiles as plan background, import road network data and display location coordinates of any point on the plan. Toggle between mapping provided by Bing, ArcGIS and Omniscale â€“ with more providers being added soon.
