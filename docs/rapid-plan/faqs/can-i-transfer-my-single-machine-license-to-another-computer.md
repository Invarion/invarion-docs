# Can I transfer my single-machine license to another computer?

Yes, but only one computer at a time can use your single-machine license. To transfer a license to another computer, follow the process below. If you run into any issues, feel free to [contact us](https://invarion.com/contact) for assistance.

**To transfer RapidPlan to another machine:**

1. Download and install Invarion Launcher on the new machine. You can find more information about the installation process [here](https://rapidplan.com/pages/launcher-installation).

2. Launch the Invarion Launcher, and log on with your current e-mail address and password.

3. The applications that require transfer will have the '**Transfer**' button next to them. Click on the '**Transfer**' button next to the application you want to transfer. That will start the standard revalidation period of about 12 hours. After revalidating, it will automatically deactivate from the old machine.

4. Once the revalidation period is over, refresh the applications list using the '**Refresh**' button in the top bar. The button next to the transferred application should now say '**Open**'.

5. Click the '**Open**' button near the application you want to use. Application files will be downloaded automatically.
