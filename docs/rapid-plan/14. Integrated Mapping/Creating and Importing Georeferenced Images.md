# Creating and Importing Georeferenced Images

## Importing Georeferenced images in RapidPlan

To import georeferenced images to a plan:

- Click Tools > Import > Georeferenced Image.
- Find and select the zip folder that houses the image.
- Click Open.

The image will be placed on your plan, matching the bearing, scale, latitude and longitude it was saved in.

Note a separate 'Georeferenced Images' layer will be created in the [Layers Palette](/docs/rapid-plan/13.%20Using%20Layers/).
The image saved here will remain at the bottom of the layers order, just above imported aerial imagery, and can not be edited.

Note that the files you're adding must cover areas adjacent to the plan location.

You can also import georeferenced images to blank canvas plans. Such plans don't have a scale and location set, so these values will be copied from the image(s) you're importing.

### Editing imported georeferenced images

If you do want to edit or change the order of the georeferenced image:

- Click the Georeferenced Images layer in the Layers Paletted, making it your active layer.
- Right click on the imported image > Send to Layer.
- Either select an existing normal layer to send it to, or create a new one.
- It can now be edited, moved and re-ordered as you require.

## Creating Georeferenced images in RapidPlan

Any image placed or imported on a RapidPlan plan that has a basemap can be saved exported as a georeferenced image.
To do this:

- Position an image as you would like it in relation to the basemap (details on how to best do this below).
- Right click on an image > Save > As Georeferenced Image.
- Save your georeferenced image.

### Placement of image

The most effective way to play your image is using the [Fit To](/docs/rapid-plan/14.%20Integrated%20Mapping/The%20Fit%20To%20tool.md) tool, see this page for more information.
If you would rather manually resize, rotate and fit an image to background mapping, it is advisable to lower the opacity of the layer you are working in, using the slide bar on the [Layers Palette](/docs/rapid-plan/13.%20Using%20Layers/). This pass-through vision allows easier matching of landmarks between the image and the background mapping.

Note that in order for georeferencing to be accurate, it is best to match the imported image to integrated mapping, or to mapping that has been correctly georeferenced itself.
