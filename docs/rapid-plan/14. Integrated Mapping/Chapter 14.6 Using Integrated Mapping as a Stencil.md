## Using Integrated Mapping as a Stencil 

You can also use integrated mapping as a guide when drawing your road layout without using the map as an imported background. The mapping can be used in preview form to **import roads and draw lane markings** to form the base of your plan, then *hide* the mapping to work further on your plan. This can be beneficial as it is more readable when printed and easier to convert to fax mode.
