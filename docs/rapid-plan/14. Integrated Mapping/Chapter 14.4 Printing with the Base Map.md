## Printing with the Base Map 

After you have completed your plan onto your base map, if you try to print you may notice that the base map is not printed with your plan. This is because the **base map preview** is not a part of the diagram. 

In order to use the map as the plan's background so it is available when printing or in offline mode, you can use the **Import Aerial Photos** tool.
