# KML and KMZ File Importing

## What is KML data?

KML shapefile data can be imported into RapidPlan and RapidPath, in order to reference, display or easily access the geographic data that the file holds. This data is presented as either clickable data points that contain word tables relevant to an area on the map, or as shapes and lines to display an area.

Relevant data types represented in this file type are boundless, but could include traffic data, development or regional boundaries, or to display a planned route to name a few.
These files are commonly used by governing bodies, and data is often readily available at their websites.

KMZ simply refers to the zipped version of KML files, used to save storage space.

## Opening and viewing KML data

In RapidPlan, click Tools > Import > KML/Shapefile.
Once you have selected your KML/KMZ file, the Import KML/Shapefile palette will be on screen and the KML data layer will be overlayed over your plan in the Canvas area.

KML objects can be clicked (either the item on plan, or listing in the Import KML/Shapefile palette) to reveal associated data.

## Importing

The Import KML/Shapefile palette will live update to display the filetree of all KML objects that are currently visible in the canvas area.

Once you have located the objects you wish to import into your plan, simple make sure that they are visible on screen and click Import Selected Features in the pallette.

If you would like to import objects from multiple areas on the canvas - simply import the object you want in one area, then pan to the next area and import desired features from there as well.

If there are objects visible on the canvas that you donâ€™t want to import, you can either uncheck them in the Import KML/Shapefile palette, or right-click them on the Canvas area, hiding them from view.

Once you have finished importing, click Finish to return to normal editing mode.
