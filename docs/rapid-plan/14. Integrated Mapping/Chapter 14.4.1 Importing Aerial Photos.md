
## Importing Aerial Photos

 - Right click on the **print region** icon (the printer in the bottom left of the print region).
 - Select Import Aerial Photos.
 - Then you can disable the base map preview with the **Toggle Base Map Visibility** icon in the toolbar so you are only working with the printable map(see below).
