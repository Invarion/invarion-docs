## Using the Curve Handles

Using the Curve Handles may initially seem a little tricky, but once you have had some practice, most people prefer the Bezier to the Spline because of the precision it offers. The crucial factor is the location of the handles relative to the control point itself, the further from the control point, the wider the sweep of the curve and vice versa. To manipulate the curve handles, click on **CTRL** and one of the handles and move your mouse in any direction. Using our shape from above, the effect of the curve handles is easily seen.
