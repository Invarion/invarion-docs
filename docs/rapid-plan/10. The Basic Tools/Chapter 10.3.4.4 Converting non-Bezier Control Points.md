## Converting non-Bezier Control Points

If you place a regular control point on a Bezier or Filled Bezier but decided you need to turn it into a Bezier point, this is easily achieved.

**To convert a standard control point to a Bezier control point:**

 - Select the **Filled Bezier** or **Bezier** by clicking on it once.
 - Click once on the control point you wish to convert. (The cursor will change to a +.)
 - Hold down **CTRL** on the keyboard and drag the handles in or out as you choose.
