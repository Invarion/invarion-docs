## The Tools

There are 20 different basic tools you can use. The majority are classed as either lines, or shapes. The Text and Image tools operate differently to all the others.

To see broken down listings of each class of tool, please visit [The Tools Palette](/docs/rapid-plan/3.%20The%20RapidPlan%20Screen/3.2.2.2%20The%20Tools%20Palette.md) page.
