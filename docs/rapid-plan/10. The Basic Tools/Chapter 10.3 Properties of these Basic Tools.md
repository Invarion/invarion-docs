## Properties of these Basic Tools

As is the case with all objects in RapidPlan, you can view and change the properties of a basic tool by double clicking on it to open the **Quick Edit** screen or from within the Properties Palette.

The properties for the **Lines** are very similar. This is also the case with the **Shapes**. Regardless of type, all the basic tools have the option to be rotated or flipped vertically and horizontally by using **CTRL + R** to rotate and the flip toolbar to flip the objects.
