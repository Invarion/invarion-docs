## Distance Markers 

There are six distance markers used for indicating spatial information on your plan, the Distance Marker, the Combined Distance Marker, the Offset Distance Marker, the Angle Marker, the Area Marker and the Combined Offset Distance Marker.

In essence, all six distance markers do exactly the same thing - they indicate to a reader the distance between elements. They all automatically calculate the distance and enter its amount. You can also enter your own values if needed.
