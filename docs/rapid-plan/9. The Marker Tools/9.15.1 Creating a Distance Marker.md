## Creating a Distance Marker

Irrespective of which distance marker you are using, the technique for creating it is much the same. However, there are some differences, so this will be explained separately for each marker below.

**To place a Distance Marker:**

 - Select the **Distance Marker** tool from the Marker tab in the Tools Palette.
 - Click once to start drawing the distance marker, click a second time to mark the end point.
 - Right click to finish

**Note**: It is helpful to hold **SHIFT** whilst drawing the distance marker to keep it straight.
