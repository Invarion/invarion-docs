# Arrows 

Frequently, you will need to draw attention to items on the plan, but will not want to use a callout box. RapidPlan provides two arrow tools for this purpose:

 - The Arrow Tool
 - The Arrow Text Tool

As the names suggest, the latter carries a text component at  its base. The arrows can be curved or straight, as shown.

## Creating an Arrow

 - Select the **Arrow** tool from the Lines tab in the Tools Palette.
 - Click to place the head of the arrow.
 - Click again for each subsequent turn point that you require.
 - When you have placed your final point, right click.
 - Right click to clear the cursor.
