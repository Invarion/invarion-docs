## The Distance marker breakline

When not drawing to scale, use the Breakline property of a Distance Marker to indicate whether the marker symbolically represents a larger on-site distance.

To enable the breakline, simply select the distance marker, in its Properties there is a subheading for Breakline. 

Simply change it from False to True and it will set the breakline in the middle of your marker. You can also adjust the size directly underneath.
