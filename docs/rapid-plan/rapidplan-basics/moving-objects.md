# Moving Objects

Of course there will be times when you will need to move a placed object  on the RapidPlan canvas. This is accomplished using the move handle.

**To move one or more objects on the plan:**

- Select the item or items that you wish to move.
- Click and drag your selected object (if you have more than one object selected, you can use any of the move handles that are showing).
- For fine placement, you can use the cursor keys on the keyboard to nudge your selection into place.
- For larger nudging steps, hold **SHIFT** key in combination with cursor keys.
