## Selecting Single Objects

There are two ways to select a single item in RapidPlan:

 - By clicking on it.
 - By dragging a selection box around it (this can also be used for selecting multiple items as specified at the end of the previous [chapter](/docs/rapid-plan/4.%20The%20Canvas/4.1.1%20Blank%20Canvas.md).
