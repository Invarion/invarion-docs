# Selecting Objects

Before you can manipulate the properties of your objects (such as the size, shape, position or rotation) you must first tell RapidPlan which item or items you want to change. You do this, by selecting your desired object(s). Sometimes you will need to select only one object, as would be the case when you want to change the size of a single sign. On other occasions you will need to select multiple items, like when you need to move and group objects at the same time. The two cases are handled slightly differently.
