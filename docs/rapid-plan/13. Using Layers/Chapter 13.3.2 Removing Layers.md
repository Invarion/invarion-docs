## Removing Layers

To delete a layer, simply ensure that you are on the layer that you wish to delete by checking in the Layer selector then click the **Delete Layer** button on the toolbar. Be careful though, because once a layer is deleted, it cant be undone.

**Note:** All objects on that layer will also be deleted.
