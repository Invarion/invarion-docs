## The Structure of the RapidPlan Layers

Imagine the layers as a set of overhead transparencies placed one on top of the other. The transparencies can be added and taken away at will (we do this in RapidPlan by changing their visibility status) meaning that at any one time you can choose to see either one or many layers at the same time.

By default, every plan starts with only one layer; the Background. Unlike all other layers that you add to your plan, the Background cant be removed.
