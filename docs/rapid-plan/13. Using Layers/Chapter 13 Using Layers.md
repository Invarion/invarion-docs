## Using Layers

*Many schemes are on just one road base...*

There will be a lot of cases where you will need to create more than one plan for a job, such as when you have multiple stages of works that need to be performed on different areas of the roadway. A good example of this is resurfacing; first, the traffic is diverted onto the right side of the road so that the left side can be asphalted, then the scheme is reversed. Some road bodies will require plans for each stage, and that's why RapidPlan offers you multiple layers on your plan. Putting the road on the background and each traffic scheme on each subsequent layer means that you only need to draw your road once.
