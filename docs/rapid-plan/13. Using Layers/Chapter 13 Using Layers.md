## Using Layers

*Many schemes are on just one road base...*

There will be a lot of cases where you will need to create more than one plan for a job, such as when you have multiple stages of works that need to be performed on different areas of the roadway. A good example of this is resurfacing; first, the traffic is diverted onto the right side of the road so that the left side can be asphalted, then the scheme is reversed. Some road bodies will require plans for each stage, and that's why RapidPlan offers you multiple layers on your plan. Putting the road on the background and each traffic scheme on each subsequent layer means that you only need to draw your road once.

## The Structure of the RapidPlan Layers

Imagine the layers as a set of overhead transparencies placed one on top of the other. The transparencies can be added and taken away at will (we do this in RapidPlan by changing their visibility status) meaning that at any one time you can choose to see either one or many layers at the same time.

By default, every plan starts with only one layer; the Background. Unlike all other layers that you add to your plan, the Background cant be removed.
