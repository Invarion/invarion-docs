When you have enabled the Plan stages on a particular layer, your layers tab will be separated into **Stage** layers and **Base** layers. 

The **Base** layers are where all of the permanent road objects, signs and markings will be displayed. The **Stage** layers are used for showing objects in different phases. For example, you can have one base layer with two stage layers - daytime setup and nighttime setup.
