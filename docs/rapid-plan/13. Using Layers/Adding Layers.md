# Adding Layers

Adding a layer is as simple as clicking the **Add Layer** button on the toolbar.

You will see a new layer name appear in the Layer selector box on the main toolbar. Anything you now draw will be placed on that new layer. You will also notice that you can no longer click on any of the items stored on other layers.

This layer characteristic is especially useful if your background is complicated and has many component pieces on it (such as lane markings/corners/etc.) and you need to drop traffic control elements over the top. It means that you wont inadvertently pick up road structures for instance, when you are trying to alter a placed cone or barricade line.
