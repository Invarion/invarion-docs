#### 13.6.1.5 DON'T have different Road Sections on different Layers

This is especially important. It's never wise to have more than one road section in the same file. Doing so is likely to lead to confusion, when you have say 4 road sections, with 3 traffic schemes each. Unless you name your layers very carefully, you are likely to loose track of which layer scheme corresponds to which road base.
