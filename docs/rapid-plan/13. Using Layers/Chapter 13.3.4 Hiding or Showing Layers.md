# Hiding/Showing Layers

One of the key benefits of multiple layered plans is the ability to show or hide different layers at different times. To show or hide a layer is very simple. Just select the layer that you want to hide or show from the Layer selector then click the **Toggle Layer Visibility** button on the toolbar (the blue eye).
