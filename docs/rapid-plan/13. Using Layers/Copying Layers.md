# Copying Layers

Right clicking on a layer will show options to **Copy** a layer, allowing you to right click > **Paste** the layer.
Alternatively, you may right click on a layer and **Duplicate** it to shorten the process.

You may also right click in unoccupied space in the **Layers Palette**, in order to **Copy Visible Layers**. Doing this will allow you to then **Paste** all visible layers, potentially duplicating many layers at once.

As a sidenote, you may also right click > **Rotate Objects** on a layer. Doing so will rotate the objects around the central point of the plan, marked by the red cross.
