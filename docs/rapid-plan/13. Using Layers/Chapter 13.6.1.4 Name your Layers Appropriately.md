#### 13.6.1.4 Name your Layers appropriately

Two weeks after drawing the plan you will probably remember what each of the 6 schemes in your plan was designed for, but what about a year down the track when you are re-excavating the same site? Chances are you might have forgotten (or another user is retrieving the plans from an old site). So name your layers appropriately. Some simple, self-explanatory names might be:

 - Stage 1 lane closure for valve removal
 - 4 week advance notice of closure
 - Footpath closure for re-concreting
 - Aftercare signage before spray seal
