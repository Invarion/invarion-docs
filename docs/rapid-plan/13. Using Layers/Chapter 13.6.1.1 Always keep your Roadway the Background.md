## Always keep your Roadway the Background 

Keeping your road on the background is almost always the most sensible place. Reordering layers in RapidPlan is possible as described above, but keeping your roads on the background will be easiest since whichever layer is listed at the top of the list will always be drawn on the canvas first - all other items on following layers are drawn in subsequent order. This means that unless you want your signs and devices to appear under the road, it should be on the bottom layer.

**Note:** In the above example objects are in Layer 1 and the road is in Layer 2.
