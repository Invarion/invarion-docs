## Editing Existing Signs 

You also have the option of editing the signs that are shipped with RapidPlan. Generally speaking, this isn't going to be necessary, but in some instances people do feel the need to make an alteration. 

Simply save the sign to a different filename and input the details of your new sign within the **Save Sign** screen or edit variations in the **Sign Editor**. This is also a technique you may use if you wish to make alterations to signs that you have created.
