# Autosave Feature

Changes made to a plan are saved automatically. The Status Bar located at the top of the page shows the autosave status.

There are three states of the saving process:

| Feature name                 |                Button                 | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | :-----------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gathering Changes**             | ![gathering changes](./Assets/ro-gathering-changes.jpg) | The system is gathering changes made to your plan. It is recommended you don't exit the page when changes are pending.       |
| **Saving** | ![Saving](./Assets/ro-saving.jpg) | The file is saving to the Invarion Cloud. It is recommended you don't exit the page while the plan is saving. |
| **Up to Date**          | ![up to date](./Assets/ro-up-to-date.jpg)| Your plan is now saved. It is now safe to exit the page. |

Panning across the map or changing plan location will not trigger the autosave function. You must draw or place an object on the canvas area to initial the autosave.

**Note** that by clicking on this icon you can learn details of the last saved version of your plan, how long it has been since a local backup has been created, as well as how many versions of the plan have been saved locally.
You will also find a link to view the history of your [saved versions](/rapidpath-online/restoring-previous-version-of-the-plan/).
