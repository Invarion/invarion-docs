# Control Points

Almost every element in RapidPath Online has at least one control point. A control point (represented by a small red circle) is a handle that allows you to alter the shape of an object.  

The image below shows a road object. Each control point has been added via a mouse click, when drawing out the object. Clicking and dragging a control point will move it, adjusting the layout of the road.

**To add a control point to an existing object:** You will see white dots with a blue outline between each control point - clicking and dragging any of these will create and place a new control point.
**To remove a control point:** Right click the control point and click *Remove Control Point*.
**To remove the last control point placed or continue placing control points where you left off:** While the object is selected, you'll find buttons for each of these controls in the [**Context Menu**](/rapidpath-online/rapidpath-online-basics/context-menu.md).

For details on how objects curve or move between control points, see the [Geometries](./geometries.md) section.
