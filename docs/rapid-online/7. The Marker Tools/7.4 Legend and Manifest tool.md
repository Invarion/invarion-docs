## Legend/Manifest tool

The Legend and Manifest tools are used as object references for your plan. The Legend box is a visual representation of any objects you have displayed. The Manifest box will give you a running total of objects placed on your plan.

### Adding a legend box

 - Select the **Legend** Tool from the Markers tab in the Tools palette;
 - Place this in the desired location on your plan;
 - Select an item on your plan that you want to appear in the Legend Box by clicking on it once;
 - Under the **Legend & Manifest** tab in the Properties palette make sure the **Show in Legend** section is set to **True;**
 - Do this for any other items on your plan you wish to appear in the legend.

**Note:** If you change Entry name from Auto to Custom, you can edit the sign entry name that displays in the Legend box.
