# Uploading Existing Plan

You can upload the plan from your computer to your online storage. This may come useful when someone shares the RapidPlanOnline ".tcp" plan with you by other means than through the Invarion Cloud, for example as an attachment to an email.

To upload existing ".tcp" file to your storage click on the "Create" button in the navigation menu and choose "Upload existing" from the menu. The plan will be uploaded to the folder you are currently in.
