# Sharing with Other RapidPlan Online Subscribers

Sharing plan with other RapidPlan Online subscribers will allow for a collaboration in creating the plan. To add collaborators to your plan click on the "Share" option in the plan's context menu or on the plan's details panel. New dialog box will appear. In the top section of the dialog enter RapidPlan Online user's email and click "Add".

Invited user will be notified about this fact in email, and the shared plan will appear in his or her "Shared with Me" section. In your storage this plan will be marked as "shared" and collaborators will be listed in the plan's details. You can add multiple collaborators to a single plan. To remove the collaborator click the "X" button near the email of the user you want to delete.
