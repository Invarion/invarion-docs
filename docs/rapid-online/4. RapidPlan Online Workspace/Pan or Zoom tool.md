# Pan/Zoom tool

The Pan/zoom tool enables you to pan across the canvas area, as well as zoom in and out. Similar to the Select tool, this can be enabled via the canvas button or in the main menu. 

To zoom in and out, simply use the wheel on your mouse. If you are using a mobile device, pinch in and out on your touch screen.

To pan across the canvas area, simply left click and drag (tap, hold and drag on a mobile device) across the workspace while the tool is active.
