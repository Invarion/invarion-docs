# Layers palette

While it is named the Layers Palette in light of its core and original use case, the Layers Palette has now expanded in function to include 3 sub-menus:
“Print regions” for managing print regions,
"Layers" for managing layers, and
"Basemap" for basemap settings.

## Print Regions

Print regions are used to select an area or areas of your plan that will eventually be exported as a pdf or image. In this section of the Layers Palette we are able to create new Print Regions, as well as managing ones and export them as needed.

In the top row of buttons in the Print Regions section of the Layers Pallette:

- **Plus icon**: Create a new Print Region.
- **Printer icon**: Print *all* Print Regions.

There is also the 3 Dots Icon, which opens a drop down menu with the following buttons:

- **Fit All To Page Size**: Fit the Print Region (blue rectangle) to the Page Preview (red rectangle).
- **Turn Off Page Preview**: Shows only the Blue Print Region, removing the external red Page Preview rectangle that matches the selected page size in your [print settings](/rapid-online/9.%20Printing%20and%20Exporting/).
- **Hide Print Regions**: Hide Print Regions so that you can work on design without distraction.
- **Orientation**: Change the orientation of the Page Preview.
- **Page Size**: Change the Page size of your Page Preview.

There will be a lot of cases where you will need to create more than one plan for a job, such as when you have different stages of works. That's why RapidPlan Online enables you to place multiple layers on your plan.

Layers will, more importantly, help you keep things organized in your plan. You can have a separate layer for roads, signs and other plan objects. Layers will improve your workflow and allow for easier changes on a more complex plan.

By default, every plan starts with only one layer, the Background.

Layers palette is divided in two three sections:

- "Print Frames" for managing print frames,
- "Layers" for managing layers, and
- "Basemap" for basemap settings.

For more about "Print Frames" visit [Print frame tool](./Print%20frame%20tool.md).
