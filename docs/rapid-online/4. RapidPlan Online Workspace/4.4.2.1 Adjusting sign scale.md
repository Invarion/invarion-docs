# Adjusting sign scale

All of the signs in the Signs palette have a default size, which is relative to the canvas area zoom level. In some instances you might need to adjust the scale of signs before placing them on the canvas area. To do this, click the gear icon on the Signs palette. This will open a scale slider. Simply move the slider to adjust the scale of the sign.
