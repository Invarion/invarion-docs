# Palettes

The Palettes are located on the left and right of the Canvas Area. Whole toolbars or specific Palettes can be shown/hidden by toggling the corresponding arrow button as pictured.

On the left side you'll find Palettes that includes everything that can be placed, imported and designed on your plan:

- [**The Tools Palette**](./tools-palette.md)
- [**Scratchpad:**](./scratchpad-palette.md)
- [**Signs:**](./signs-palette.md)

On the right, Palettes alter an object or your plan:

- [**Properties**](./properties-palette.md)
- [**History**](./history-palette.md)
- [**Layers**](./layers-palette.md)

The following sections describe the functions of each palette in detail.

**Note:** Palettes can be minimized using the small arrows on the left of their purple header bar.
Minimizing a whole toolbar can be helpful for maximizing the canvas area when preparing larger scale plans.
Minimizing certain palettes can be helpful when they arenâ€™t needed, as it allows more space for the other palettes.
