## Context menu items for single-item selections

* **Maximise:** Show a larger version of the **Context Menu**.
* **Continue Drawing:** Place more control points, starting from where you had previously completed drawing the object.
* **Remove last CP:** Remove the last control points placed.

* **Cut:** Like **Copy** but removing the original object.
* **Delete:** Delete the item.
* **Arrange:** Move the item backward or forward in comparison to other objects on the same [layer](/rapid-online/rapidplan-online-workspace/layers-palette.md).

* **Style:** Save the **Properties** of the object to your **Styles**, that can then be **Applied** to an object of the same type in the future - using the same **Style** button in the **Context Menu**.
