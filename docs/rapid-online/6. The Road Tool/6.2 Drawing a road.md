## Drawing a road

 - Select the **Road** from the Tools palette.
 - Move your mouse to the canvas and click once to start drawing your road.
 - Move the mouse around the canvas, clicking at each control (turning) point.
 - When you have placed your final point, right click to stop drawing.
 - If you don't want to draw another road, right click again to drop the road tool.

**Tip:** A simple shortcut allows you to draw perfectly straight roads. By holding **Shift**, the tool will make sure that each control point is placed in a perfectly straight line. Move the move left or right, and the straight section of road will 'jump' in 15 degree increments.
