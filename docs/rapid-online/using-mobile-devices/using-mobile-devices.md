# Using Mobile Devices

Tap on to your canvas area to begin using the selected tool. Each tap on the canvas area will then create a new control point. When you have finished your last point, tap with two fingers to finish drawing that segment, then tap again with two fingers to conclude drawing

**Note:** You can also tap, hold and drag when using a tool to control the direction of the next object control point.
