# Placing and Adjusting Signs

## Placing signs

Placing signs is simple. Once your sign is placed you can move, resize and rotate it.

**To place a sign:**

- Select the desired sign from the The Signs Palette by clicking on it;

- Float the sign out onto the canvas with the mouse. Note that you don't have to hold the mouse button while you drag your sign;

- Click to drop the sign on the canvas.

**Note:** The layout of the Signs palette was discussed [here](/docs/rapid-online/RapidPlan%20Online%20Workspace/Signs%20palette.md). Please note this section details using the signing on your canvas area.

## Adjusting signs

Once a sign is placed on the canvas area, there are a couple of ways you can adjust it.

**To Flip by 90 degree increments:**

Right click on selected sign, go to Flip, then select Horizontally or Vertically.

## To Rotate freely

The orange handles on the exterior of the sign allow you to freely adjust the orientation of the sign. Simply left click and hold to move the sign at any angle.

## To Resize signs

The yellow handles on the outer of the sign allow you to adjust the signs size, simply left click and drag out to desired size. To resize the sign uniformly, simply hold down the **Ctrl** key while resizing it.
