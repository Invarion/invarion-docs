# Placing signs

Placing signs is simple. Once your sign is placed you can move, resize and rotate it.

**To place a sign:**

- Select the desired sign from the The Signs Palette by clicking on it;

- Float the sign out onto the canvas with the mouse. Note that you don't have to hold the mouse button while you drag your sign;

- Click to drop the sign on the canvas.



### Note

The layout of the Signs palette was discussed [here](/docs/rapid-online/RapidPlan%20Online%20Workspace/Signs%20palette.md). Please note this section details using the signing on your canvas area.
