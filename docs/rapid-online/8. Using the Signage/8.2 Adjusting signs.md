## Adjusting signs

Once a sign is placed on the canvas area, there are a couple of ways you can adjust it. 

**To Flip by 90 degree increments:**

Right click on selected sign, go to Flip, then select Horizontally or Vertically.

**To Rotate freely**

The orange handles on the exterior of the sign allow you to freely adjust the orientation of the sign. Simply left click and hold to move the sign at any angle. 

**To Resize signs**

The yellow handles on the outer of the sign allow you to adjust the signs size, simply left click and drag out to desired size. To resize the sign uniformly, simply hold down the **Ctrl** key while resizing it.
