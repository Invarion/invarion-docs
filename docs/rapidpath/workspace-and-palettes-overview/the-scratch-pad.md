# The Scratch Pad

The Scratch Pad is used to store objects that you commonly use to make them easily accessible.

## Scratchpad management

Right clicking on an object *inside* the scratch pad will allow you to remove it or **reorder buttons**.
In the reorder buttons menu you will be able to click and drag scratch pad items into different orders, as well as using the slidebar control at the bottom to change the size of icons in the scratchpad.
Once you are finished in the reorder screen, click OK done to finish.
