# Properties of the Road Tool

Of all the tools in RapidPath, the Road has by far the most power and flexibility. Accordingly, there are a great many settings you can alter to set your road up as you require. You can change:

- Road color, geometry and auto merge
- Lane number, width, color and lane markings
- Left side/right side edge line, shoulder and sidewalk widths and colors
- Distance markers
- Legend and manifest preferences

All of the above settings are accessed through the road properties screen. You can access the properties screen by double clicking on the road you need to change from the Quick Edit mode or from the Properties palette.

## Alter geometry and color

The Road section of the road's properties allows you to adjust the color, the road geometry (Spline, Line or Bezier) and auto merge preferences.

**To change the color of the road in the properties palette:**

- Select the road on your plan
- Select the **Road** section on the properties palette
- Select the **Color** bar (the blue bar the image below)
- Some color options will become available for you to choose from

The **auto merge** feature controls whether a new road will automatically merge with the selected road. As shown below, when set to **True** it means the new road will automatically merge, **False** means it will not.

Each line marking on a road is set individually, so you can have different markings for different lanes. Each extra lane you add will accessible in the Markings section.

## Sides of the Road

By default, each road is drawn with both a left and right edge line shoulder and sidewalk. You can set the width of the shoulders and sidewalks, or choose to turn them off completely. The left and right sides can be configured individually, and as such do not need to be the same in appearance.
