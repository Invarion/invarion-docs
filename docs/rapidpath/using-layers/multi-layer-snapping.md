# Multi-Layer snapping

This method of snapping allows you to snap to objects on all visible layers. This is particularly useful when drawing complex plans with multiple stages/layers, as it allows hassle-free snapping to base stage objects like road lanes and edges.

Hold **Ctrl+Alt** while drawing or transforming objects to allow snapping to objects on all layers that are not hidden.
