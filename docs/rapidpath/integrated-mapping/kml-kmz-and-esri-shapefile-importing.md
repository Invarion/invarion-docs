# KML, KMZ and ESRI Shapefile Importing

## What are KML, KMZ and ESRI Files?

These files can be imported into RapidPath in order to reference, display or easily access the geographic data they hold. This data is presented as either clickable data points that contain word tables with relevant information about the coordinates in which it is located, or as shapes and lines to visually display information about that area.

Relevant information represented in these file type are boundless, but could include traffic data, development or regional boundaries, or to display a planned route to name a few.
These files are commonly used by governing bodies, and data is often readily available at their websites.

KMZ simply refers to the zipped version of KML files, used to save storage space.
ESRI shapefiles' file name displays with the suffix '.shp'.

## Opening and Viewing KML/Shapefile Data

In RapidPath, click Tools > Import > KML/Shapefile.
Once you have selected your KML/KMZ/SHP file, the Import KML/Shapefile palette will be on screen and the data layer will be overlayed over your plan in the Canvas area.

KML/Shapefile objects can be clicked (either the item on plan, or the listing in the Import KML/Shapefile palette) to reveal associated data.

## Importing

The Import KML/Shapefile palette will live update to display the filetree of all KML/Shapefile objects that are currently visible in the canvas area.

Once you have located the objects you wish to import into your plan, simple make sure that they are visible on screen and click Import Selected Features in the palette.

If you would like to import objects from multiple areas on the canvas - simply import the object you want in one area, then pan to the next area and import desired features from there as well.

If there are objects visible on the canvas that you donâ€™t want to import, you can either uncheck them in the Import KML/Shapefile palette, or right-click them on the Canvas area, hiding them from view.

Once you have finished importing, click Finish to return to normal editing mode.
