# Working Offline or via Proxy

For users who have limited internet connectivity at their workstation, a proxy mode is available. This setup requires a networked server with internet access. Please contact Invarion for more information on utilizing this feature.

RapidPath also allows usage of the program even without an Internet connection with the Work Offline option. For a user's login to remain valid, they will need to log in online at least once every 14 days.
