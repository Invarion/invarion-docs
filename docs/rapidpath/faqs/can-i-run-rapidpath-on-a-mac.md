# Can I run RapidPath on a Mac?

RapidPath can run on a Mac with applications like **Parallels**, **VMWare**, or **Boot Camp**. If you buy RapidPath for your Mac and arenâ€™t fully satisfied with running it through VMWare or one of the other options, we do offer a 14-day money back guarantee. Give it a try!
