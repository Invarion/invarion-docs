# What licensing options are available for RapidPath?

We have two commercial licensing options available:

**Single-Machine** Licenses are ‘per end user machine’. If you are wanting to run RapidPath on two computers, two licences are required.

**Multi-Machine** Licenses enable you to download the software onto any number of Windows capable machines (including a network), and register any number of users. Users can then only access the product simultaneously based on the number of purchased licenses (or “seats”). For example, if you purchase one license, only one registered person can access the RapidPath at any one time.
