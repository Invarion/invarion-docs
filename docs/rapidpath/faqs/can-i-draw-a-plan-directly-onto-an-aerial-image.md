# Can I draw a plan directly onto an aerial image?

Yes, RapidPath can display a **dynamic basemap preview** on the plan drawing canvas. You can then download aerial tiles as plan background, import road network data and display location coordinates of any point on the plan. Toggle between mapping provided by Google, Bing, ArcGIS and more.
