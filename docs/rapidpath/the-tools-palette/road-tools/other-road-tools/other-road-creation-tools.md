# Other Road Creation Tools

Often, the road tool alone will be all you need to create your roadway. Other times you will need some extra pieces to make your road look the way it should. RapidPath has many more tools which compliment the road tool and allow you more options in your plan creation. They can be found in the Roads tab of the Tools Palette.

## The Turn Lane Tool

This tool is used for making a slip lane or a turning lane.

- Click again around the middle of the turning lane to place a control point
- Place your final click where you want your turning lane to end
- Right click to drop the tool
