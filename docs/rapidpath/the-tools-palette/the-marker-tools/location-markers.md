# The Location Marker

The Location Marker is an annotion tool in the form of a small labelled pin that can be used to indicate the location of particular points of interests on a plan.

The location marker tool is found in Annotation category of the [Tools Palette](./assets/location-marker%20-%20small.png)
Once it's selected, simply click on the Canvas Area where you would like a marker to be located. If a Location Marker is moved, by default the coordinates displayed will adjust in kind.

If you would like to place a marker at a known coordinate rather than placing it on a landmark seen on the plan, the [Dimension Input Panel](/docs/rapidpath/object-properties-and-transformations/dimension-input-panel.md) can be used: Simply select the Location Marker tool, click the letter **C** on your keyboard, and then type or paste your coordinates into the dialog box and click **Enter**.
