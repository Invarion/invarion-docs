# Adding Signs to RapidPath

**Please note that the advice in this section regarding signs assumes that a signs add-on has been purchased for your RapidPath license.**

While RapidPlan comes with a signs add-on, RapidPath comes with a vehicles add-on included.<br />If signs are required, the add-on suited to your region can be purchased at [invarion.com](invarion.com) > ["Buy a Subscription"](/docs/account-management/buying-a-subscription.md).

Note that if you already have RapidPath and need to add a signs add-on to it, add-ons can be purchased at [invarion.com](invarion.com) without adding a license to your cart. <br />Once purchased, the add-on would need to [Assigned to your license](/docs/account-management/managing-company-accounts.md) in the [Account](/docs/account-management/accessing-your-account.md) section of [invarion.com](invarion.com).
