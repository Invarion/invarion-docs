# Using the Invarion Cloud

RapidPath now features incorporated cloud functionality, allowing you to:

- Store your library of plans securely, and access them from anywhere.
- Seamlessly collaborate with team members or clients by adding them to a plan and providing editing or view-only access.
- Add comments and create comment threads to discuss aspects of your plan during the design process.
- Quickly share a link to your plan so relevant stakeholders can view a read-only version on their mobile devices.
- Plan files created in the desktop applications can be opened and edited by our web applications, and vice versa.

## Creating a Cloud Plan

As discussed in [The Home Screen](/docs/rapidpath/the-home-screen-and-starting-a-plan/the-home-screen.md), a cloud plan can be created in a number of ways.

[**New Plan Wizard**](/docs/rapidpath/the-home-screen-and-starting-a-plan/the-new-plan-wizard.md), found on the home screen as well as in [The Toolbar](/docs/rapidpath/the-toolbar/the-toolbar.md) can be used to create cloud and local (locally saved) plans. In the final step of creating a plan using New Plan Wizard, the button highlighted below will decide whether a plan is saved to the cloud or locally.

A cloud plan can be created by clicking **New Cloud Plan**: Note this will create a plan befitting the defaults you have set (in Tools > Preferences > Defaults in the [Toolbar](/docs/rapidpath/the-toolbar/the-toolbar.md)).
