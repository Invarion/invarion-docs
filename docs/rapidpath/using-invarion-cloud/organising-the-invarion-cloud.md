# Organising the Invarion Cloud

The Invarion Cloud can be opened by clicking **Browse Invarion Cloud** on the [Home screen](/docs/rapidpath/the-home-screen-and-starting-a-plan/the-home-screen.md), or the button by the same name in the [Toolbar](/docs/rapidpath/the-toolbar/the-toolbar.md) under *File*.

Here we will discuss how to sort, view and arrange plans in the Invarion Cloud.

## The Invarion Cloud Layout

The Invarion Cloud screen will display in a new tab within RapidPath, as seen below.

## Invarion Cloud file tree

A file tree is visible on the left side of the Invarion Cloud page:

|**File Tree Heading**|**Details**|
|-|-|
|**Home**| As picture above, the home page of the Invarion Cloud features a staggered list of recently used plans, the most recently used being featured in *Quick Access* at the top.|
|**Favorites**| Lists plans saved as favorites by clicking the 3 dots button next to them > *Add to Favorites*.|
|**Plans**| Lists all plans and user-created sub-folders.|
|**All Plans**| Puts sub-folders aside, listing all plans in a single list.|
|**Plans Shared with Me**| Lists plans created by another user, who has listed you as a *Collaborating User*, granting edit permissions.|
|**Trash**| Holds deleted plans for 30 days before it is emptied (contents being permanently deleted).<br />It can be emptied immediately by clicking '**Empty Trash Now**'.|

## Managing and Altering Plans in the Invarion Cloud

Each cloud plan can be altered using its drop-down **Context Menu**, or using the **Details Side Panel**.

The **Context Menu** is a slightly more efficient means to make changes to the plan. <br />The **Details Side Panel** will provide some information about the plan along with controls.

### Plan Context Menu

clicking the **3 dot button** of a plan will reveal the **Context Menu** menu:
