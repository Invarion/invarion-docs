## How does the annual renewal work?

We let you know 45 days in advance of your license expiry date so you will have plenty of time to renew your license and maintain access to the software and all updates.

At RapidPlan, we know how valuable our software is for saving you time when creating accurate traffic plans, so we like to give you even one less thing to worry about and more time saved with our renewal reminders.
