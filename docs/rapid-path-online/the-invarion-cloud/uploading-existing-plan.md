# Uploading Existing Plan

You can upload the plan from your computer to your online storage. This may come useful when someone shares the RapidPlan Online **.tcp** plan with you by other means than through the Invarion Cloud, for example as an attachment to an email.

To upload existing **.tcp** file to your storage click on the **Create** button in the navigation menu and choose **Upload existing** from the menu. The plan will be uploaded to the folder you are currently in.
