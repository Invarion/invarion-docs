RapidPlan Online can be used on any mobile device that has a web browser. The application will simply adjust the screen to fit, based on the device you are using.

## 8.1 Creating and selecting objects

### 8.1.1 Creating objects

To use tools/vehicles on a mobile device, simply tap the tool/vehicle you wish to use. Tapping on your screen is the same action as a left mouse click.

Tap on to your canvas area to begin using the selected tool. Each tap on the canvas area will then create a new control point.

**Note:** You can also **tap, hold and drag** when using a tool to control the direction of the next object control point.

### 8.1.2 Selecting objects

To select an object, simply **tap** on the object.

To select multiple objects, simply **tap, hold and drag** across the objects you wish to select and create a [selection box](https://rapidplan.net/webinstall/manual/rapidplan-online/#select-tool).

To access the Context menu tap the object and the menu will appear.
