# I see that Invarion has an extensive sign library, but how do I create an additional custom sign?

We will be happy to create a new sign for you at no additional cost if you send your requirements to [support@invarion.com](mailto:support@invarion.com)

Alternatively, if you would like to create a new sign for your traffic control plan or adjust existing signs for your own specific preferences, you can follow these steps:

**To create a new sign:**

1. Illustrate your sign using the primitive objects tools
2. When done drawing your sign, select all of the elements of your sign by dragging a selection box around all items you wish to include.
3. **Right click** on one of the items and select Group.
4. If you wish to save this sign for later use, **Right click** on it and select Save Object/Save as Sign.
5. After entering a name for your sign, click on the Save button and choose a location where you would like to save the file. The default routes to My Documents/RapidPlan/Signs.

**Note:** After saving your sign it will be available within the Custom tab in the signs palette.
