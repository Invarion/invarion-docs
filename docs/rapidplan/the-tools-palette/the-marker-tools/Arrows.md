# Arrows

Frequently, you will need to draw attention to items on the plan, but will not want to use a callout box. RapidPlan provides two arrow tools for this purpose:

- The Arrow Tool
- The Arrow Text Tool

As the names suggest, the latter carries a text component at  its base. The arrows can be curved or straight, as shown.

## Creating an Arrow Text
