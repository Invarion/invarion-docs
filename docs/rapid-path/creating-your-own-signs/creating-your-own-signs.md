# Creating Your Own Signs

One of the very powerful features RapidPath has to offer is the capability to create new signs from inside the program itself. Basic users may only wish to create basic signs for inclusion on their plans, and may not want to save them back into the sign galleries. More advanced users however may wish to create different versions of each sign, with sign codes, multiple color schemes (day Vs night etc.) and so on. This Chapter handles both cases.

Creating and saving your sign isn't difficult, but it does take some practice. Every sign inside RapidPath was built using these techniques, so if we can do it, so can you! This chapter does contain some advanced techniques that are covered elsewhere in the user manual. It is a section recommended for more proficient users who are comfortable with the objects and grouping/un-grouping and file manipulation (load, save, etc.).

***RapidPath signs are made in RapidPath***

That's right - every sign inside RapidPath has been created from within the program, so you can use the same tools we did to create your own signs. It also means that you can save valuable time by simply editing the existing signs in the package to make new ones.
