# What file formats are supported when importing to RapidPath?

RapidPath can add images that are in **BMP**, **JPEG**, **GIF**, and **PNG** format, including the ability to import **DXF** and **ERSI** files.

**For BMP, JPEG, PNG and GIF images**, just go to Primitive Objects, and select Image In the Files of Type drop down menu and you will see the image formats RapidPath can place on a plan.

**For DXF and ERSI images**, go to Tools, then Import.
