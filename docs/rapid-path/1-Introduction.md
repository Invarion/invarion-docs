# Introduction

Thank you for purchasing RapidPath, Invarion's swept path analysis tool.

RapidPath is an extension for RapidPlan, the World's leading software for creating traffic control plans. It was developed to meet the needs of users whose traffic plans require swept path analysis to comply with project requirements.

With RapidPath you will be able to simultaneously create a traffic control plan and directly overlay a Swept Path Analysis evaluation.

RapidPath runs in the RapidPlan software, if you are also learning how to use RapidPlan for the first time, you can review the RapidPlan user manual [here](http://rapidplan.net/webinstall/manual/rapidplan-3.5-user-manual/).
