### Predefined Styles improvements

![Predefined styles improvements](./assets/133034891024137589-predefinedStyles.png)

Predefined object styles can now automatically adjust scaled properties to the current plan scale. This lets you use on-site units to specify values for properties like road lane width or delineator spacing and use such styles to draw objects with the correct dimensions on plans at different scales.

Additionally, individual styles can now be added to the Scratchpad for quick access and it's much easier to create custom style icons.

RapidPath can now lay out required devices and signage for a selected set of simple typical jobs. Pick the location, specify worksite dimensions and let our algorithms do the rest.

### Selection Preview

![Selection Preview](./assets/132265940378251142-selection_preview.png)

The selection box will now highlight captured objects while you're dragging, letting you see what gets selected. A great way to improve precision especially on complex plans with many objects. And while we're at it, here's a quick guide to the available selection modes:

Selection Modes

![select new](./assets/132265972498216871-SelectNew.png) New selection (default)

![select add](./assets/132265972337855817-SelectAdd.png) Add to selection (hold Shift key)

![select subtract](./assets/132265972192419013-SelectSubtract.png) Remove from selection (hold Alt key)

Capture Modes

![select contained](./assets/132265972642441432-SelectContained.png) Contained objects (default)

![select intersecting](./assets/132265972767013513-SelectIntersecting.png) Intersecting objects (use right mouse button)

### Spellcheck improvements

![Spellcheck Improvements](./assets/132265940280538350-spellcheck.png)

### Inverted Crop

![Inverted Crop](./assets/132265940480780884-inverted_crop.png)

Remove bits that obstruct the view underneath or create fancy cutout shapes using the new Inverted Crop option. This feature will be particularly useful if you ever import a CAD-style page frame as an image - you can then crop out the viewport bit to reveal the plan content.

### Restore from Autosave

![Restore from Autosave](./assets/132265940590028514-autosave.png)

Ever lost work because you accidentally closed a plan without saving it? Use File->Undo close tab to get out of trouble, or just open the plan again and - Rapid will check for the last autosaved version. The latest autosaved versions of all plans are preserved for 14 days and accessible via the Help -> Restore autosaved plans dialog.

### More changes

**Distance Marker breakline** - when not drawing to scale, use the Breakline property of Distance Marker to indicate where the marker symbolically represents a larger on-site distance.

**Default aerial tiles provider setting** - you can now set the default aerials import tile provider independently of the default base map provider. This is useful if you normally use cartograpic maps as your plan canvas background, but import tiles from a satellite imagery provider.

**Imported aerial tile details** - each aerial tile will now preserve information about when it was imported, from which provider and which survey (where available). Select the tile to see this information - it will help you work out whether the tiles might need updating should you reuse the plan on another occasion.

**NearMap survey selection improvements** - when selecting a NearMap survey during aerial photos import, a small preview is presented for the selected survey, letting you quickly pick the one with the best level of detail.

**Improved QLD satellite provider** - the QLD satellite provider now uses the new service hosted by the QLD government, providing better quality imagery in most locations.

**Color blind support** - the default color of some on-canvas decorations can now be adjusted in the settings for improved visibility over base maps.

### Integrated Base Maps

![Integrated Base Maps](./assets/131460791504765237-IntegratedMapsShort.png)

RapidPath can now display a dynamic base map preview on the plan drawing canvas, download aerial tiles as plan background, import road network data and display lat/lng coordinates of any point on the plan. All you need to do to enable these features is specify plan location and scale. You can toggle between maps provided by Bing, ArcGIS and Omniscale, but we're planning to add even more providers in future RapidPath releases.

### New Plan Wizard

![New Plan Wizard](./assets/131460777682562447-NewPlanWizard.png)

Use the New Plan Wizard to quickly specify all properties of a new plan you're creating. The wizard integrates the creation of four basic plan types: Blank canvas, Base map, From template and From PDF.

### Unrestricted Canvas

![Unrestricted Canvas](./assets/131460778029969993-UnrestrictedCanvas.png)

The plan drawing canvas is now fully unrestricted. Scroll to its edges and it'll expand automatically. Use print regions to indicate which parts of the canvas you want to include on printouts.
TIP: the "Scroll to origin" button will help you quickly go back to diagram center.

### Copying Object Styles

![Copying Object Styles](./assets/131460778115456897-CopyObjectStyles.png)

After you copy an object to clipboard, select another object and use the Paste Style tool (Ctrl+Shift+V) to have all the properties of the original object automatically applied to it.
TIP: use the Duplicate Style tool (Ctrl+Shift+D) to draw an object using the same style as your current selection.

### Editing Text

![Editing Text](./assets/131460779045204977-EditingText.png)

All objects containing text can now be easily edited on-canvas. Simply double click on the text you want to change and start typing.

### Batch Print

![Batch Print](./assets/131460779161267489-BatchPrint.png)

Batch Export tool is now accompanied by Batch Print - a dialog that lets you quickly print multiple plans. Both dialogs have a new clean design and allow selecting print regions you want included on the printout.

### Performance improvements

![Performance Improvements](./assets/131460793367381357-PerformanceImprovements.png)

RapidPath has been redesigned to make the most out of your computer's capabilities. It is now quicker, more responsive, uses less memory and loads TCPs up to 10 times faster than before!

### Distance Markers

![Distance Markers](./assets/131460808545362765-DistanceMarkers.png)

Auto Distance Markers have been merged into the corresponding Distance Marker tools, so each marker can now display site distance in the selected units (Default), or custom text - depending on its Marker Mode property value. Additionally, we've added a Combined Offset Distance Marker Tool, as well as new text alignment options for all marker types.

### Plan Properties

![Plan Properties](./assets/131460826185352505-PlanProperties.png)

You can now specify job location coordinates for each traffic control plan you're drawing. Other than integrating base maps, in the future this will allow you to search your plans by location (show all plans in a selected area). Additionally, job start and end dates can be specified.

### More changes

 **Custom spellchecker dictionary** - add words and phrases you often use so that SpellCheck knows they're valid.

**Properties panel improvements** - advanced editors for Stroke, Fill, Text and other properties. Adjustable ordering and searching.

**Redesigned Quick Edit dialog** - if you prefer the dialog over the Properties panel, the new Quick Edit tool now allows you to edit all object properties.

**Reorganized toolbars, menus and keyboard shortcuts** - quick access to the tools you use the most.

**Improved diagram rulers** - accurate rulers that help you measure Site, Page or Pixel distances on your plan.

**Non-blocking background operations** - load, save, print, export and autosave operations are much quicker and run in the background without blocking the RapidPath window.

**Swap zoom & pan keys** - if you prefer using the Control key over Shift for mouse-wheel zooming, you can now enable this option in Preferences.

**Resizing print regions** - print regions can now be freely scaled in each direction. Hold the Shift key down while scaling to preserve region proportions.

**Arc Pie tool** - a new tool for drawing filled arc figures.

**Dotted Hatch fill** - primitive objects can now be filled with a CAD-like Dotted Hatch brush.

**Better lane markings customization** - lane marking dash lengths and gaps can now be accurately adjusted for all lane marker styles. Additionally The dedicated Lane Marker tool has a new Mask property, which by default lets you automatically cover up any underlying markers.

**Accurate plan Edit Time** - the Edit Time counter only ticks when the plan is open and its tab currently active.
