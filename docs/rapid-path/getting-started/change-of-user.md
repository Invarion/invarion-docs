# Change of User

If a license is assigned to a new user who, presumably, would want to use a different login username, Invarion Support must be duly notified of such a change so that the necessary update will be made on the records of the license involved. Without prior notification, the new user using their own email address as the username will not be able to log in due to an account mismatch.

**Check Invarion [website](https://invarion.com/locations/) for the corresponding Support contact number of the country you're in.**
