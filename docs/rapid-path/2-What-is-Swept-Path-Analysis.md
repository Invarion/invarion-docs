# 2. What is Swept Path Analysis?

Swept Path Analysis calculates and examines the behavior of a moving vehicle, with all its parts, during turning manoeuvres. This is required to determine whether the surrounding infrastructure provides the vehicle enough space to navigate through safely.

Swept Path Analysis can be used to assess if:

- Large vehicles can pass through a junction or road work without causing damage;
- Vehicles are likely to encroach upon pedestrian space while moving through turns;
- Emergency vehicles can quickly access buildings;
- Large vehicles can pass each other side-by-side when turning;
- Buses can accommodate the routes they serve;
- There is enough space to reduce the need of vehicles reversing;
- There is enough space for vehicles to reverse;
- Delivery vehicles can safely approach loading bays;
- Parking bays can accommodate different types of vehicles;
- And many more.
