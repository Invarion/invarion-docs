# Managing licenses

Users with Admin access can also manage the licenses and add-ons within their account.

Clicking to the "Licenses" page will display the list of licenses you currently own, as well as their assigned users.

Each row shows the product, license type, expiration date, add-ons and the employee a license is assigned to.

## Assigning users to a license

To assign a license to employees, click on the action icon for that license, and select the checkbox for each user requiring access to that license. 

For multi machine licenses you can select any number of users. For Single machine licenses, only one user can be assigned.

To unassign a user from a license, click the action button and remove them. 
  
If you have purchased any product add-ons, like additional sign or vehicle libraries, they can be assigned to a license by clicking the action button and selecting ‘’assign addon’’. Note that once an add-on is assigned to a license, it cannot be unassigned. If you would like to detach it from a license, please contact our Support team.
