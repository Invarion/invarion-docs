# Buying a subscription
  
To purchase a new product subscription, click on ‘’Buy subscription’’. Please note that only employees with Administrator access can purchase products for the company. If you need to purchase new licenses, please contact one of your assigned Company administrators or our Technical Support team.

On this page, simply select your products and add-ons you wish to purchase.

Once a subscription is purchased, it will then appear on your Licenses page, so you can assign them to employees.
